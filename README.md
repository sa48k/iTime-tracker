Amesbury School - Maire iTime Tracker

Make the tracker sheet writable to all with link in domain on weekday mornings, then lock it so it is open to teachers only after school.

Run the 'CreateTriggers' function ONCE to create the triggers for each weekday. Default: set PUBLIC at 8am, set LOCKED at 3pm (+/- 15 mins)
Triggers can be checked at https://script.google.com/home/triggers
